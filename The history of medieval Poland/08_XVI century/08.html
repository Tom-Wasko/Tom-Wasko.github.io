				<div class="row">
					<p>In 1505 the Nihil novi act transferred most of the llegislative power from the monarch to the Sejm. This event started a period known as "Golden Liberty".
					<br>In the 16th century folwarks, massive agriculture businesses, were gainig popularity. Similar to the roman latyfundia they slowly destroyed the middle class, and made szlachta even more powerfull.</p>
					<p>Also in the 16th century in Europe there were many Protestant Reformation movements, which often oppressed religions, luckily for them Poland was very tolerable. Because of that Poland at that time was a very religion-wise diverse country.</p>
					<p>Under the reign of  Sigismund I, in 1525 the Teutonic Order was almost annihilated; Duke Albert promised soverenity to Poland and in 1929 Mazovia was finally incorporated to Poland</p>
					<p>Sigismund II was the last ruler from the Jagiellonian dynasty, douring his life he finally created a real union with Lithuania under the “Union of Lublin”.</p>

				<div class="row">
					<h3>Golden Age of the Renaissance in Poland</h3>
					<p>Under the rule of  King Sigismund I the Old and King Sigismund II Augustus, Poland witnessed growth in the culture and science.</p>
					<p>In this era  Nicolaus Copernicus published his papers about the rotation of Earth, and  Jan Kochanowski wrote many magnificent works, for which he would be considered the greatest poet before Adam Mickiewicz.</p>
